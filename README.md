</p>

## Setup

```bash
# Rust nightly required at the moment
rustup default nightly

# Build ors-loader.efi and ors-kernel.elf
make

# Run on QEMU
make qemu
# ... is equivalent to
./qemu/make_and_run_image.sh \
    target/x86_64-unknown-uefi/debug/ors-loader.efi \
    target/x86_64-unknown-none-ors/debug/ors-kernel.elf
```

## Comparison

ors is based on [MikanOS](https://github.com/uchan-nos/mikanos), [blog_os (Second Edition)](https://os.phil-opp.com/), and [xv6](https://github.com/mit-pdos/xv6-public).

[^1]: Maintaining the x86 version have stopped, and switched to the [RISC-V version](https://github.com/mit-pdos/xv6-riscv)
[^2]: [UEFI is planned](https://github.com/phil-opp/blog_os/issues/349)
[^3]: Supports only very limited reading (by UEFI Block I/O)
[^4]: [RISC-V version of xv6](https://github.com/mit-pdos/xv6-riscv) supports VirtIO over MMIO
[^5]: blog_os supports [Cooperative Multitasking](https://os.phil-opp.com/async-await/) at the moment
[^6]: Read-only support
[^7]: Simpler but similar to modern UNIX file systems, including crash recovering

## Resources

- ors uses [Tamzen font](https://github.com/sunaku/tamzen-font).
- ors uses [One Monokai Theme](https://github.com/azemoh/vscode-one-monokai) as a color scheme of the terminal.
